## My process
I did the suggested workflow. Mobile-first design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first design
- Responsive design

### What I learned

I practiced designing the project steps first mentally, cleaning up my code, aligning the profile photo to the middle, and the difference between the :hover and :focus selectors.


### Continued development

I will aim to take on more challenging projects. This one I have finished under a couple of hours.
